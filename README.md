# 📚 ClarifAI

A modern, document-grounded Q&A web application for students. Upload your study PDFs and ask questions—get accurate, contextual answers *anchored in your own material*.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to deliver precise, context-aware answers based on your uploaded documents. It combines Information Retrieval (IR) with the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), ensuring that responses are relevant and directly tied to your study materials.

## 🛠️ Core Technologies

- **PDF Parsing:** Extracts text and metadata from PDFs (e.g., PyPDF2, pdfminer.six, PyMuPDF).
- **Text Chunking:** Splits extracted text into manageable “chunks” for embedding (by size, paragraph, or semantics).
- **Embedding Model:** Transforms text chunks and questions into semantic vectors (e.g., SentenceTransformers, Hugging Face models, OpenAI/Cohere APIs).
- **Vector Store:** Database optimized for similarity search (e.g., FAISS, ChromaDB, Milvus, Pinecone).
- **LLM (Large Language Model):** Generates final answers based on user question and relevant context (e.g., GPT from OpenAI, open-source models like Llama, Mixtral).
- **Orchestration:** Frameworks like Langchain or LlamaIndex simplify integration and RAG workflow management.
- **Web Backend:** FastAPI, Flask, or Django (Python), or Node.js/Express (JavaScript).
- **Web Frontend:** React, Vue, Angular, or plain HTML/CSS/JS.

## 🧩 Typical User Flow

1. **Web Interface:** User logs in and selects a document from their catalog.
2. **Upload/Select PDF:** PDF is uploaded or chosen; backend stores it (temporarily or permanently).
3. **Processing Pipeline (Async):**
    - Extract text from PDF.
    - Chunk text.
    - Generate embeddings for each chunk.
    - Index embeddings in the vector store (linked to document/user).
4. **Ask a Question:** User submits a question about the document.
5. **Query Pipeline:**
    - Generate embedding for question.
    - Search vector store for top-K relevant chunks (“context”).
    - Construct prompt for LLM including question and retrieved context.
    - LLM generates final answer.
6. **Display Answer:** Backend sends answer to frontend; user sees response.

## 🎯 Target Audience & Value Proposition

- **Who:** University & high school students.
- **Problem Solved:** Quickly find specific answers and review concepts within large study PDFs—no more endless scrolling or unfocused AI replies.
- **Value:** A digital “study buddy”:
    - Understands key concepts in your own documents.
    - Finds precise answers fast.
    - Enables interactive review.
    - Keeps your study focused on what matters.

## 🏆 Competitive Advantages

- **Anchored Responses:** Answers are always grounded in your material—minimizing LLM “hallucinations.”
- **Privacy:** Works with your private class notes, slides, and books.
- **Component Flexibility:** Swap out embedding models, vector stores, or LLMs as needed.
- **Usability:** Simple, student-first interface.

---

## ⚔️ Competition

- **Search Engines (Google, etc.):** Not document-specific.
- **General AI Chatbots (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.):** May not stick to your document context; can require paid plans.
- **PDF Readers/Annotators (Adobe Acrobat, etc.):** Only basic text search and annotation, no semantic Q&A.
- **Other RAG Tools:** May exist, but this project focuses on usability, relevance, and affordability for students.

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Frontend:** SPA (Single Page Application) in React/Vue/Angular, communicates via REST/GraphQL APIs.
- **Backend:** API server orchestrating PDF processing and RAG pipeline.
- **PDF Processing Module:** Handles extraction, chunking, embedding, and indexing (may run as a background service).
- **RAG Core Module:** Handles question processing, vector search, and LLM interaction.
- **Vector Store:** Dedicated database (self-hosted or cloud).
- **LLM Service:** External API (OpenAI) or self-hosted open-source model.

**Key Considerations:**
- **Session/State:** Track documents and user sessions for seamless follow-up questions.
- **Asynchronicity:** PDF processing may be slow—handle in background to avoid blocking UI.
- **Scalability:** Not critical for MVP, but design considers bottlenecks (PDF processing, vector search, LLM calls).
- **Security:** Input validation, secure file management, potential API rate limiting.
- **Deployment:** Flexible—Heroku, Vercel, university server, or any cloud provider.

## 📈 Opportunity & Adoption

- **Opportunity:** Free/affordable, easy-to-use, student-focused RAG Q&A tool with reliable, document-grounded answers.
- **Adoption:** Viral among students via word of mouth, university events, student forums. Simplicity is key!
